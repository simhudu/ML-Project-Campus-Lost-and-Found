This dataset was used for training the Random Forest Model which created the category_classifier.plk in "modules" folders.

It's not needed anymore. We're just giving it if you wish to train it yourself on your local machine.

Take this entire folder with ~6500 images contained in 13 sub folders (item categories) and put it in the "data" folder and run database_seeder.py
